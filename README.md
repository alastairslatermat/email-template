# Email templates for use by Government services

Two candidate HTML templates for use by UK Government services.

V1 based on previous work in GDS, HMRC and HO on emails. [example](http://alphagov.github.io/email-template/email_template_1.html)

V2 based on Fog Creek's [minimal responsive email template](https://gist.github.com/tinabeans/6996367). [example](http://alphagov.github.io/email-template/email_template_2.html)


Changes implemented:

* GOV.UK as text with separate crown graphic
* GOV.UK colour tweaked to prevent GMail from changing the colour
* explicit fonts set throughout
* format detection for numbers turned off - telephone numbers have to be marked up explicitly
* grey footer text added
* Crown converted to gif for Lotus Notes (NB may need to be served as http)
